# usasurvey

A simple, single‑page survey for Americans and non‑Americans, designed to raise awareness by presenting factual information in a neutral, non‑confrontational way.

The goal is not to collect data or track users, but to make a fact‑based overview easier to share — especially across groups that may not usually engage with the same information.

## Why This Exists

This survey is meant to help spread factual information in a tone that does not alienate anyone — not even people who strongly support Trump.

It purposely avoids hostility:  
pro‑Trump users are **not** criticised, pressured, or insulted.  
Instead, they are encouraged to share the survey just like everyone else, ensuring that people with different views all see the same information.
The intention is simple:

- People with very fixed opinions will not change their minds, regardless of how we address them.  
- The survey exists for the **middle group** — those who might still reconsider their position when they compare sources and see the facts laid out clearly.  
- It is **not** about gathering statistics; it is about **sharing information** as widely as possible.  
- A variation that does collect data is allowed, though.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute in any of the following ways:

- **rewrite copy**  
  Improve clarity, tone, or wording while keeping the survey accessible to all audiences.

- **improve accessibility**  
  Enhance screen‑reader support, keyboard navigation, contrast, and overall usability.

- **optimize layout**  
  Simplify structure, improve readability, refine spacing, or enhance mobile responsiveness.

- **optimize texts and links (while keeping everything civil and respectful)**  
  Ensure the survey remains neutral in tone so it can be comfortably viewed and shared by people with any political perspective.

- **add translations**  
  Help make the survey available in multiple languages so it can reach a broader audience.

### Important note  
The survey is intentionally designed so that **pro‑Trump users also feel encouraged to share it**, not pushed away.  
Reaching that group is essential: the wider the distribution — across supporters, critics, and everyone in between — the more people will see the same facts.

Pull requests are welcome.
